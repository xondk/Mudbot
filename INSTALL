All you have to do is to type 'make', and pray. If all works well, you
should be able to run the newly created './bot' executable, which will use
the newly created *.so files.

Should make fail, this is how a manual compile is done:
bot - gcc [extra flags] -o bot main.c -lz -ldl
modules - gcc [extra flags] -o name.so -shared name.c

Compiling requires a MinGW package. Downloading Dev-Cpp is an easy way to
get it, without any setup needed.

Edit (not run) mk.bat, and change the path to your MinGW applications (make,
gcc, dlltool, etc). Run it, and pray.
